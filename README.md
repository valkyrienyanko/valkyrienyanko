🌱 I'm looking to collaborate with fellow C# (Go/Re)dot developers on open source tools that can be used across various game projects.

🐈‍⬛ I’m also interested in collaborating on closed source projects that align with my personal interests. Some of the games I enjoy include Rainbow Six Vegas 2 (specifically the terrorist hunt mode), Project Zomboid, Minecraft, Terraria, Stardew Valley, Path of Exile, Kittens Game by Bloodrizer, Dark Souls, and Age of Empires. I recognize that these genres come with their own unique challenges, such as creating smooth 3D animations, handling pathfinding, and managing complex game systems. With that in mind, I believe it's important for us to develop a comprehensive Game Design Document to guide the project. If we’re confident in our vision and execution, I’d be eager to dive in and contribute to making it a reality.
